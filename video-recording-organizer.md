My app is called fli-video

I will have global and project level configuration.

Global file is `~/.fli-video.json`

```
{
  "ecamm-recordings": "~/Movies/Ecamm Live Recordings",
  "project-root-folder": "/Volumes/Expansion/Sync/tube-channels/a-cast/cast-active"
}
```

Project configuration files will live in the project folder and will be named '.fli-video.json' or '.fv.json'

```
{
  folders: {
    "recordings": "./recordings",
    "chapters": "./chapters",
  }
}
``
