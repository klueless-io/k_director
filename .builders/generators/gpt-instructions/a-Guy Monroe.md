Guy Monroe

Did I give a damn about 


I'm focusing on : XYZ (Playtime)

Sell the guy: (Only way to sell the guy is to) - 
Make someone believe 
To make someonebody beleive me

Are you a good liar?
Are you a truth teller?

Present truth, present innocence


Brad sells me, How?

Brad Pitt - Tells The truth
He is authentic, I can trust


How do bring the person into the feeling of Matt Daomon
Brad Pitt,
Be vulnerable, to feel the specific feelings, without lie
With no hesitation, no doubt,


The people I admire can do
High Stakes: PLAY


Breakups, law suits, fights, loss of carrer going on in big actors
and then they are asked to "ACTION"

Brad Pitt, Daomon, Matt: Sell Them Theselves


Tony: They sell themselves 


Make the person feel
You must feel

Matt makes Matt feel
Brad make Brad feel
Tom makes Tom feel

You must feel (during a high stakes film) - 


Flow and order

1, 2, 3, 4 = Life of your dreams, goal xyz

If I am not having a good time, then they don't care.

Life Threatening.

Need to change the lense, (live giving) - He inspires me
Brad makes us feel

Let go of the reality around them.
But how (in a High Stakes)

To manipulate the world, he must manipulate himself.

Create a safe space.


SAFE PLACE
1. Activities
2. Strategy / Plan


Plan

What to do.Do the degree that you are self inspired, Matt Damon is closing Matt
Brad is beiliefinbg in himself
Do I beleive in myself 10 out of 10


My job is to sell my self (this is all Acting Class is)

To sell or close self

Use these tools to create evidence and proof that I am the best

1. Mind - To think thoughts that inspire
  - The lense that I am looking through
  - What inspires me, e.g. Kirtan, Dance
  - It's not just words, but you really need to create the feeling
  - There is an angel in my head, not a devil
2. Eyes - Objects (seek out objects)
3. Voice - To inspire, raising pitech, speeding up ,slowing down, lower pitch
4. Gestures - To Inspre
5. Face - Express Inspire
6. Movement - Inspire

Switch from negative lense to positive lense

Regard it as Play
